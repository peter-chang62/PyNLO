def gamma_to_g3(v_grid, gamma, t_shock=None):

    Convert from the gamma to the g3 nonlinear parameter.

    The `t_shock` parameter is used to determine the strength of the
    self-steepening effect when gamma is only given at a single point. If an
    array is given for gamma, it is assumed to already contain the
    self-steepening effect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v_grid : array_like of float
        The frequency grid.
    gamma : array_like
        The effective nonlinear parameter.
    t_shock : float, optional
        The characteristic time scale of optical shock formation. This
        time scale is typically equal to ``1/(2*pi*v0)``, where `v0` is the
        frequency at which `gamma` is defined, but it may also contain
        corrections to `gamma` due to the frequency dependence of the optical
        mode. This parameter is only valid if `gamma` is given at a single

    Calculate the frequency-domain Raman and instantaneous nonlinear response
    function.

    This calculates the normalized Raman response using approximated formulas
    in the time domain. The total Raman fraction from the resonant and boson
    contributions should be less than 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of points in the time domain.
    dt : float
        The time grid step size.
    r_weights : array_like of float
        The contributions due to resonant vibrations. Must be given as
        ``[fraction, tau_1, tau_2]``, where `fraction` is the fractional
        contribution of the resonance to the total nonlinear response function,
        `tau_1` is the period of the vibrational frequency, and `tau_2` is the
        resonance's characteristic decay time. More than one resonance may be
        entered using an (n, 3) shaped array.
    b_weights : array_like of float, optional
        The contributions due to boson peaks found in amorphous materials. Must
        be given as ``[fraction, tau_b]``, where `fraction` is the
        fractional contribution of the boson peak to the total nonlinear
        response function, and `tau_b` is the boson peak's characteristic
        decay time. More than one peak may be entered using an (n, 2) shaped
        array.
    analytic : bool, optional
        A flag that sets the proper normalization for use with the analytic or
        real-valued representation. The default normalizes for the analytic
        representation, which is the proper format for use with the `NLSE`
        model. Set this parameter to `False` if using the `UPE` model.

    Returns
    -------
    rv_grid : ndarray of float
        The origin-continuous frequency grid associated with the nonlinear
        response function.
    nonlinear_v : ndarray of complex
        The frequency-domain nonlinear response function. This is defined over
        the frequency grid given by ``dv=1/(n*dt)``.

    Notes
    -----
    The equations used are the approximated formulations as summarized in
    section 2.3.3 of Agrawal's Nonlinear Fiber Optics [1]_. More accurate
    simulations may be obtainable using digitized experimental measurements,
    such as those shown in figure 2.2 of [1]_. The coefficients listed in
    Agrawal for silica-based fibers are as follows::

        r_weights = [0.245*(1-0.21), 12.2e-15, 32e-15] # resonant contribution
        b_weights = [0.245*0.21, 96e-15] # boson contribution

    For the carrier-resolved or real-valued representation, an additional
    factor of 3/2 is necessary to properly normalize the Raman response. The
    formulas used in this method have been fit to the analytic representation,
    which is normalized assuming that all three self-phase modulation pathways
    fold through baseband. In the real-valued domain however, only two pass
    through baseband. The third pathway is through the second harmonic. Thus,
    in the real-valued representation the Raman response must be normalized to
    produce the same nonlinear response against 2/3 the spectral amplitude.
