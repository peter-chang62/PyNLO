    Notes
    -----
    The combined noise of a coherent state's amplitude and phase quadratures is
    equal to that of the vacuum. A coherent state :math:`|\\alpha\\rangle` is
    defined by the displacement :math:`\\alpha = x_1 + i \\, x_2`, where
    :math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2` are the "amplitude" and "phase" (real and
    imaginary) quadrature amplitudes. In the number state basis
    :math:`|n\\rangle`, a coherent state takes the form of a Poissonian
    distribution:

    ..  math::
        |\\alpha\\rangle = e^{-\\frac{|\\alpha|^2}{2}}
            \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\alpha^n}{\\sqrt{n!}} |n\\rangle

    The probability :math:`P[\\alpha]` of measuring displacement
    :math:`\\alpha` from a coherent state with average displacement
    :math:`\\beta`, a simultaneous measurement of :math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2`,
    is as follows:

    ..  math::
        P[\\alpha] = \\frac{1}{\\pi} |\\langle \\alpha | \\beta\\rangle|^2
            = \\frac{1}{\\pi} e^{-|\\alpha - \\beta|^2}

    This probability distribution is Gaussian, and its noise can be completely
    described by calculating the variance of each quadrature component. Scaled
    to the number of photons (:math:`N=\\alpha^2`), the combined noise from
    both quadratures gives a total variance of one photon per measurement:

    ..  math:: \\sigma_{x_1}^2 = \\sigma_{x_2}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}

    ..  math:: \\sigma_\\alpha^2 = \\sigma_{x_1}^2 + \\sigma_{x_2}^2 = 1

    The width of the probability distribution is independent of the coherent
    state's average displacement, which can be zero. This means that the
    root-photon noise can be generated independent of the state by sampling a
    normal distribution centered about zero mean. Also, since the Fourier
    transform of Gaussian noise is also Gaussian noise, the root-photon noise
    can be equivalently generated in either the time or frequency domains.
    Normalizing to the number of photons per measurement interval, the root
    photon noise for both quadratures becomes ``1/(2 * dt)**0.5`` for the time
    domain and ``1/(2 * dv)**0.5`` for the frequency domain. The final
    root-power noise is found by multiplying the frequency domain root-photon
    noise by the square root of the photon energy associated with each bin's
    frequency.

# %% Time and Frequency Grids


class TFGrid:
    """
    Complementary time- and frequency-domain grids for the representation of
    analytic functions with complex-valued envelopes.

    The frequency grid is shifted and scaled such that it is aligned with the
    origin and contains only positive frequencies. The values given to the
    initializers are only targets and may be adjusted slightly. If necessary,
    the reference frequency will be increased so that the grids can be formed
    without any negative frequencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of grid points.
    v_ref : float
        The target central frequency of the grid.
    dv : float
        The frequency step size. This is equal to the reciprocal of the total
        time window.
    alias : int, optional
        The number of harmonics supported by the real-valued time domain grid
        without aliasing. The default is 1, which only generates enough points
        for one alias-free Nyquist zone. A higher number may be useful when
        simulating nonlinear interactions.

    Notes
    -----
    For discrete Fourier transforms (DFT), the frequency step multiplied by
    the time step is always equal to the reciprocal of the total number of
    points::

        dt*dv == 1/n

    Each grid point represents the midpoint of a bin that extends 0.5 grid
    spacings in both directions.

    Aligning the frequency grid to the origin facilitates calculations using
    real Fourier transforms, which have grids that start at zero frequency. The
    `rtf_grids` method and the `rn_range` and `rn_slice` attributes are useful
    when transitioning between the analytic representation of this class to the
    real-valued representation.

    By definition of the DFT, the time and frequency grids must range
    symmetrically about the origin, with the time grid incrementing in unit
    steps and the frequency grid in steps of ``1/n``. The grids of the `TFGrid`
    class are scaled and shifted such that they represent absolute time or
    frequency values. The scaling is accomplished by setting the forward scale
    parameter of the Fourier transforms to ``dt``. The `v_ref` and `t_ref`
    variables describe the amount that the `TFGrid` grids need to be shifted
    to come into alignment with the origins of the grids implicitly defined by
    the DFT.

        """
        Complementary time and frequency domain grids for the representation of
        analytic functions with real-valued amplitudes.

        The `alias` parameter determines the number of harmonics the time grid
        supports without aliasing. In order to maintain efficient DFT behavior,
        the number of points can be extended further based on the output of
        `scipy.fft.next_fast_len` for aliases greater than or equal to 1. An
        alias of 0 returns the set of time and frequency grids consistent with
        a real-valued function defined over the original, analytic `t_grid`.

        The resulting frequency grid contains the origin and positive
        frequencies and is suitable for use with real DFTs (see `fft.rfft` and
        `fft.irfft`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        alias : float, optional
            The harmonic support of the generated grids (the number of
            alias-free Nyquist zones). The default is 1, the fundamental
            harmonic.
        fast_n : bool, optional
            A flag that determines whether the length of the new array is
            extended up to the next fast fft length. The default is to extend.
            This parameter has no effect when the `alias` is 0.
        update : bool, optional
            A flag that determines whether to update the real-valued time and
            frequency domain grids of the parent object with the results of
            this method. The default is to return the calculated grids without
            updating the associated values stored in the class. This parameter
            is only valid when `alias` is greater than or equal to 1.

        Returns
        -------
        n : int
            The number of grid points.
        v_grid : array of float
            The origin-contiguous frequency grid.
        v_ref : float
            The grid reference frequency.
        dv : float
            The frequency grid step size.
        v_window : float
            The span of the frequency grid.
        t_grid : array of float
            The time grid.
        t_ref : float
            The grid reference time.
        dt : float
            The time grid step size.
        t_window : float
            The span of the time grid.

        Notes
        -----
        To avoid dealing with case-specific amplitude scale factors when
        transforming between analytic and real-valued representations the
        frequency grid for complex-valued functions must not contain the origin
        and there must be enough points in the real-valued representation to
        avoid aliasing the Nyquist frequency of the analytic representation.
        The initializer of the `TFGrid` class enforces the first condition, the
        frequency grid starts at minimum one step size away from the origin,
        and this method enforces the second by making the minimum number of
        points odd if the real grid only extends to the first harmonic.

        The transformation between representations is performed as in the
        following example, with `tf` an instance of the `TFGrid` class, `rtf`
        the output of this method, `a_v` the spectrum of a complex-valued
        envelope defined over `v_grid`, `ra_v` the spectrum of the real-valued
        function defined over `rtf.v_grid`, and `ra_t` the real-valued
        function defined over `rtf.t_grid`. The ``1/2**0.5`` scale factor
        between `a_v` and `ra_v` preserves the integrated squared magnitude in
        the time domain::

            rtf = tf.rtf_grids()
            ra_v = np.zeros_like(rtf.v_grid, dtype=complex)
            ra_v[tf.rn_slice] = 2**-0.5 * a_v
            ra_t = fft.irfft(ra_v, fsc=rtf.dt, n=rtf.n)
            np.sum(ra_t**2 * rtf.dt) == np.sum(np.abs(a_v)**2 * tf.dv)
