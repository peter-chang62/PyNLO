    "where $\\lfloor ... \\rfloor$ represents the floor function, and the range of the summation indices $m$ and $n$ are chosen so that the summation indices are the same as the coordinate indices. The transform given by the first equation is called the inverse Fourier transform ($\\nu \\to t$) and that given by the second is called the Fourier transform ($t \\to \\nu$).  The definitions require sampling at a discrete set of points, but *these relationships carry no approximations* with respect to the periodic functions $f\\!\\left[t\\right]$ or $F\\!\\left[\\nu\\right]$. Due to the efficient [fast Fourier transform](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FastFourierTransform.html) (FFT) algorithms, DFTs are preferred when performing Fourier transforms numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting side effect of the discrete Fourier transform is that along with the periodicity of the time domain, the representation in the frequency domain becomes periodic as well. The time range $\\pm 1/(2 \\, d\\nu)$ is the periodic time window that corresponds to sampling the frequency domain in steps of $d\\nu$. Similarly, the frequency range $\\pm 1/ (2 \\, dt)$ is the periodic frequency window due to sampling the time domain in steps of $dt$. The frequency $\\nu = 1/ (2 \\, dt)$ is called the [Nyquist frequency](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NyquistFrequency.html) and is the maximum allowed frequency for a given time-domain step size. Components that are at frequencies greater than the Nyquist frequency will [alias](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Aliasing.html), or wrap, back onto the primary grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equations represent discrete integrals over **points that are centered on** $t_m$ ($\\nu_n$) **and extend in bins of** $\\pm 0.5 \\, dt$ ($\\pm 0.5 \\, d\\nu$). Thus, the transforms span the entire periodic windows:\n",

    "\\Delta \\nu &= N \\, d\\nu = 1/dt\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is readily seen for grids that contain an odd number of points but requires some more careful consideration when the number of points is even. The minimum coordinate index in that case is $-N/2$, which is exactly at the Nyquist frequency, and the maximum index is at $N/2 - 1$, which is one step size below Nyquist. To complete the window, one must alias the half step down from $-N/2$ to the half step up from $N/2 -1$. This means that for an even number of points the information at the positive Nyquist frequency is aliased down to the negative. While there is enough information to fully represent the sampled points, as predicted by the sampling theorem there is in general not enough to reconstruct the sampled function in its entirety. Thus, a discrete Fourier transform *sampled with an even number of points* is only generally valid *if there is no amplitude at the Nyquist component*. One special exception is the discrete Fourier transform of a purely real function. For this case, due to the complex-conjugate symmetry inherent to the Fourier transform of a real function the positive and negative Nyquist terms are real and equal, so a DFT sampled at the Nyquist frequency will return two times the amplitude of the actual Nyquist components. The full real-valued function can then be reconstructed by taking half of the amplitude of the negative Nyquist component and placing it in a frequency bin at the positive Nyquist component.\n"

    "Analytic formulations are useful when representing physical quantities, and interface nicely with complex-valued fft and ifft functions. However, there are times when the real-valued representation can be more efficient or practical, such as when dealing with nonlinear operations. Numeric packages include fft implementations that specifically transform real input and that calculate and return only the positive half of a spectrum. With the help of array indexing operations, these **rfft** and **irfft** operations allow simple translation between analytic and real-valued representations:\n",

    "An important property of these functions is that *the output of a rfft does not have the same number of points as its input*. In general, the frequency domain output array has $N = \\lfloor N_r/2 \\rfloor + 1$ number of points, where $N_r$ is the total number of points in the time domain. This does not pose any complications when using the rfft, but in general *the number of real output points must be explicitly given to the irfft function*. The reduced number of points in the frequency domain has another implication, *the frequency domain output array is always arranged such that the coordinates are in monotonic order*. The time-domain array is still ordered as described in the previous section, but since the rfft only returns the positive side of the spectrum the array ends before the coordinates have aliased. The slight caveat to this is that the Nyquist frequency (when reached) is considered positive instead of negative.\n",

    "The first condition states that the amplitude at the origin of the analytic array is unchanged with respect to the real-valued representation. The frequency bin at the origin extends over both positive and negative frequencies regardless of the representation. To preserve the integrated power, the power in that bin must not change. When the number of points in the real representation is even, the last bin contains information aliased from both the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies. The second condition states that the power is only preserved if one Nyquist component is considered, only half of the combined amplitude can be retained. In addition to the amplitude renormalization, the first and last point of the rfft array must be complex-conjugate symmetric about the origin. This means that the amplitude at the origin must be real, and, if the number of points in the real representation is even, the amplitude at the Nyquist frequency must also be real.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the added complexity of keeping track of those details, it is easier to just not include the origin or the Nyquist frequency in the analytic array, i.e. to have both the origin and the Nyquist frequency of the real-valued representation be configured to have zero amplitude. This is easily accomplished by starting the frequency grid of the analytic representation away from the origin and using an odd number of points if the sampling is Nyquist limited. With that restriction, transformations from one representation to the other need only use a uniform $\\sqrt{2}$ scale factor at all points.\n"
