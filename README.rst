PyNLO: Python Nonlinear Optics
==============================
This package is a fork of the original PyNLO, a package for modeling the nonlinear interaction of light with matter. It started as an attempt to add 2nd-order nonlinearities to the pulse propagation model and grew into a large-scale rewrite. It is not yet at feature parity with the original, but it is getting close! Contributions and suggestions are welcome.


Introduction
------------
The PyNLO package provides an easy-to-use, object-oriented set of tools for modeling the nonlinear interaction of light with matter. It provides many functionalities for representing pulses of light and nonlinear materials.

Features:
	- A solver for the propagation of light through materials with both 2nd- and 3rd-order nonlinearities.

	- A highly-efficient adaptive step size algorithm based on the ERK4(3)-IP method from `Balac and Mahé (2013) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2012.12.020>`_.

	- A flexible object-oriented system for treating laser pulses and optical modes.

	- ...and much more!


Installation
------------
PyNLO requires Python 3. If you do not already have Python, the Anaconda distribution is a good all-in-one collection of Python packages. PyNLO depends on the the NumPy, SciPy, Numba, and mkl_fft packages. Matplotlib is necessary if viewing real-time simulation updates or if running the example code.

The easiest way to install this fork is to download or clone the repository into a directory of your choice, and then insert that directory into your `sys.path <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path>`_ variable before importing the package. To test the installation, try out the scripts in the examples folder.
